# breast_cancer_classification
In this project, we aim to build a **classification model** that can discriminate between the **malignant** and **benign** cancer based on the given characteristics for each type.
I have trained a logistic regression model that is mainly trained to detect the malignant cancer such that this model could reach a **precision of 99.5%** which is the true positive accuracy and a **recall of 95%.**
I still can say that our model is able to be more improved by trying to raise it's recall with respect to it's precision to minimize the possibility that the model to predict it's a benign cancer although it's not which is a critical situation.
